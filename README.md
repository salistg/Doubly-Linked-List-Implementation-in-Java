# Doubly-Linked-List-Implementation-in-Java

My own Double Linked List implementation in Java. 
Contains methods for:
1. Inserting at the head of the list
2. Deleting data from the list
3. Checking if the list is empty
4. Accessing the data at the head
5. Accessing the data at the tail
6. Finding the index of a certain piece of data
7. Changing the data of a list to another data
8. Checking the data is at a certain index
9. Printing the data of the list
